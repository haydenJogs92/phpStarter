This is a simple PHP starter project that uses gulp for live reload.

Skeleton Framework is included.

To use this project, simply download from github, then run:

npm install --save-dev


Once node_modules is in place, then run the command:

gulp

To launch the project on a local server.

When editting a CSS or JS file, gulp will automatically minify each file individually and reload the server.
